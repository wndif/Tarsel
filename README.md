# Tarsel - ICCD2022:Fault Localization for Hardware Design Code with Time-Aware Program Spectrum

#Dependencies: 
Python3.8, Modelsim

1. The benchmark we use is from **CirFix: Automatically Repairing Defects in Hardware Design
Code** (https://github.com/hammad-a/verilog_repair);
2. We provide a script (.do) to collect program coverage information in each program;
3. Our experimental process is still in the process of continuous optimization and improvement. We will provide complete coverage matrix information as soon as possible.
