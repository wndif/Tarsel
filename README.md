# Tarsel - ICCD2022:Fault Localization for Hardware Design Code with Time-Aware Program Spectrum

#Python3.8, Modelsim

1. The benchmark we use is from CirFix: Automatically Repairing Defects in Hardware Design
Code;
2. We provide a script (.do) to collect program coverage information in each program;
3. Our experimental process is still in the process of continuous optimization and improvement.
